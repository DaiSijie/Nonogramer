# Nonogramer

Import and play on your favorite [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) grids! If you feel like playing straight away, there's a bunch of grids already in the app, and there is also a _random_ mode which is quite challenging.

## How to Run

1. Make sure to have Java installed.
2. Double click on Nonogramer.jar.
3. Alternatively, run ```java -jar <path/to/jar>```on your favorite terminal.

A simple Android App to interact with [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) in an interactive manner. Move your finger and observe the optimal partition evolve in real time! 

## How to Run
Since 2024, the app is no longer featured on Google playstore (that was too much work to maintain). Still, you can get the APK directly from this repo and run it on your phone.

## Code Highlights

See the parser class for some basic computer vision algorithm and stream decoding.
