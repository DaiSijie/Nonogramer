<font style ="font-size:12px; text-decoration:underline">How to play</font>
<p style="text-align:justified">A nonogram aka picross, is a simple paper game. The aim is to decide for each small pixel if it is black or white. Once you've done the whole grid, a picture should appear.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">The only informations you have to complete de grid are the small numbers at the begining of each rows and columns. They tell you the length of black pixel series and their order. For instance, if at the top of one column it is written 5 and 6 you know that you will have 0 or more whites, then 5 black, then at least one white, then 6 black and then 0 or more white.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">When your are sure that a pixel is white, click on it's case until the case is crossed, if you are sure that a pixel is black then click until the case is black. You can have a preview for your picture by going on <i>preview</i> tab.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">To move the cursor in the grid, you can either use your mouse or the arrow keys in combination with enter-key.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">For further explanations and game strategys, please take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justified">You can change the theme of the game by right-clicking in a nonogram window.</p>

<font style ="font-size:12px; text-decoration:underline">Opening & saving a grid</font>
<p style="text-align:justified">You have four ways of opening a grid. First, by choosing a grid in the combo box and clicking "Play!". Second by copy/paste the console text in <i>ImageCodingComparator</i> (be sure to have output format set on binary). As of this version only normal encoding is supported. You can also open a grid by importing a pixelised black and white picture. For the former, it is required to give the number of rows and the number of columns. The last way to open a grid is by generating random data, but beware that you have no assurance on the uniquenessof the solution.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">Imported grids can be saved in library for next use, just check "add to library", then give it a name and a level. If you want to manage saved grids or restore the library as it's inital state, use appropriate buttons: <i>delete</i>, <i>manage</i> and <i>restore</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justified">It is now known that determining if a grid has more than one possible solution is a really hard problem to solve, therefore <i>Nonogramer</i> cannot garantee that your imported grid is unique. But it will be shown in status if the solution you found match the information but not the initial picture.</p>
